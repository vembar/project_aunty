Dear Advice Sister Alison: "I had a decent professional job until I was laid off 9 months ago. Soon, my unemployment compensation ran out and then, my savings. I accepted a secretarial job to tide me over, thinking it would just be temporary. A few months passed and the company decided to make my job permanent. I still didn't have any good job prospects, so I reluctantly agreed to stay....but I hate this job! I'm bored. I detest the brainless, repetitive tasks. I miss making decisions for myself. I'm afraid my professional skills will get rusty. Most of all, I'm afraid of being stuck in the secretarial pool, and never getting a job in my field again. I'm still job hunting but I'm getting to the point where I feel no one will ever want to hire me. Can you help me get out of the "pink collar ghetto?"
